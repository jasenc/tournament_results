# Tournament Results

This project is designed to capture the results of tournament outcomes, it does not utilize any external libraries. The database was developed using PostgreSQL and all programs use Python. Tournament Results is comprised of three files:

* `tournament.py`: a program that houses all relevant functions needed to properly execute a Swiss Pairings style tournament.
* `tournament.sql`: a database that houses all required information for `tournament.py` to execute properly, most notably tables to keep track of player information as well as match outcomes.
* `tournament_test.py`: a file as a mock tournament to adequately test all functions of `tournament.py` as well as the database tables of `tournament.sql`.
